Hi <%= @order.name.split(" ").first %>,

I just got the list of books you asked for- cool!

Thank you for supporting our experiment. I hope you read the books and put them
to good use or share it again after you are done!

If you wouldn't mind sharing on social media, that'd be cool. Something like:

"Just grabbed a programming book for free from https://www.shareprogrammingbooks.com"

ORDER DETAILS
=============

Order ID: <%= @order.uuid %> (https://www.shareprogrammingbooks.com/orders/<%= @order.uuid %>)

Your books:
<% @order.books.each do |book| %>

<% end %>

Thanks again!

P.S Your books should arrive in 1-2 weeks. We'll send you an email when they
get shipped but unfortunately USPS Media Mail does not have tracking numbers!
